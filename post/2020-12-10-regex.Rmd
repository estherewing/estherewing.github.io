# Regular Expressions
A regular expression, also known as regex, is a part of Python that is useful for finding matches of specific search patterns. 

## Regex Symbols

These symbols below are used to match any or specific characters! It may seem like it is a lot, but don't worry! The more you practice, the easier it gets.

This might be confusing if this is your first time learning regex. Let's look at some examples with these symbols to help you understand regex better!


##Regex Examples

###Using re.findall(r"expression", string)
re.findall(r"expression", string) is used to find all matches of a pattern.

Let's say that we have a string, `I love my cat!` and that we want to match every alphanumeric character.

Since we only want alphanumeric characters, we will use `\w`, which will match every alphanumeric character. Note that we will get a list of single characters because we did not use `+` or `*` to match more characters.

```{python}
import re

string="I love my cat!"
re.findall(r"\w", string)
```

But now, let's put `+` after `\w`. This will match any alphanumeric character occurring one or more times!

```{python}
import re

string="I love my cat!"
re.findall(r"\w+", string)
```


Now, it's your turn! 
Write a Python program that matches all numbers from the string, `Louis is a yellow tabby cat. He will turn 6 in May 2021. He is pretty chubby because he loves to eat. He weighs about 17 pounds. He gets fed 3 times a day. Occasionally, he would get about 5 pieces of treats. He sleeps about 14 hours a day.` You can do this in many different ways, but use `\d` for this example!


Answer:
```{python}
import re

string="Louis is a yellow tabby cat. He will turn 6 in May 2021. He is pretty chubby because he loves to eat. He weighs about 17 pounds. He gets fed 3 times a day. Occasionally, he would get about 5 pieces of treats. He sleeps about 14 hours a day."

re.findall(r"\d+", string)
```

I hope you have a better understanding of regex and how to use `re.findall()` to find anything you want! I will write more blog posts to teach you more about regex. Stay tuned!
