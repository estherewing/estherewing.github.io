# Pushing your website up to GitHub
Just follow these steps to push your website to GitHub!

1. Go to your terminal

2. Type `pwd` to check your directory. You will get something like `/stor/home/ek8435/website/public`

3. Type `git init` to initialize the local git repository. You will get something like `Initialized empty Git repository in /stor/home/ek8435/website/public/.git/`

4. Type and run `git add .`

5. Type and run `git commit -m "test site"`

6. Link your computer to your GitHub repository by running `git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/test_repo.git`. For me, my command looks like `git remote add origin https://github.com/estherewing/estherewing.github.io.git`. You can go to GitHub and copy this command.

7. Finally, run `git push origin master` and type in your username and password.

8. Voil√†! Your website is now up on GitHub!
