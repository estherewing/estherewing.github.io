This is my cat, Louis! =^._.^=

Louis is a yellow tabby cat, and he is 5 years old. He likes to eat, look out the window, groom himself, and sleep.

He is not the nicest cat, but he has a really pretty voice. He is really soft also. 

He used to be an indoor/outdoor cat, but he would dig up our neighbors' gardens that we now have to keep him inside :( He would still try to run out the door whenever he gets a chance.

Louis is pretty smart. He observed my family opening doors, using door handles, that he learned to open doors by himself. He would randomly come into my room when he is bored. 

Louis can be really goofy and funny, too!
