      <description>Coding can be difficult, but you are not alone!  Regular Expressions A regular expression, also known as regex, is a part of Python that is useful for finding matches of specific search patterns.
Regex Symbols These symbols below are used to match any or specific characters! It may seem like it is a lot, but don&#39;t worry! The more you practice, the easier it gets.</description>

      <description>Reticulate Whenever you need R and Python to work together and share information, you can use reticulate.
This is fairly easy!
When you insert a chunck (shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+I OR Command+Option+I), you will see {r}. That means that that chunk will be using R. You can change {r} to {python} to simply switch the chunk to a Python code chunk.
First, you need to run library(reticulate) in the R code chunk to make R and Python communicate with each other!</description>

      <description>Meet Louis!   This is my cat, Louis! =^._.^=
 Louis is a yellow tabby cat, and he is 5 years old. He likes to eat, look out the window, groom himself, and sleep.
 He is not the nicest cat, but he has a really pretty voice. He is really soft also.
He used to be an indoor/outdoor cat, but he would dig up our neighbors&#39; gardens that we now have to keep him inside :( He would still try to run out the door whenever he gets a chance.</description>

      <description>Modeling Guidelines and Rubric  0. (5 pts) Introduce your dataset and each of your variables (or just your main variables if you have lots) in a paragraph. What are they measuring? How many observations?  My dataset contains data regarding global land temperature change of major cities in the world collected from 1849 to 2013. The variables of this dataset are date (dt), average temperature, average temperature uncertainty, city, country, latitude, and longitude.</description>

      <description>Esther Kim (ek8435) Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Rubric Prerequisite: Finding appropriate data from at least two sources per the instructions above: Failure to do this will result in a 0! You will submit a .Rmd file and a knitted document (pdf).
0. Introduction (4 pts)  Write a narrative introductory paragraph or two describing the datasets you have chosen, the variables they contain, how they were acquired, and why they are interesting to you.</description>
