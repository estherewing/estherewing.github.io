      <description>Coding can be difficult, but you are not alone!  Regular Expressions A regular expression, also known as regex, is a part of Python that is useful for finding matches of specific search patterns.
Regex Symbols These symbols below are used to match any or specific characters! It may seem like it is a lot, but don&#39;t worry! The more you practice, the easier it gets.</description>

      <description>Reticulate Whenever you need R and Python to work together and share information, you can use reticulate.
This is fairly easy!
When you insert a chunck (shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+I OR Command+Option+I), you will see {r}. That means that that chunk will be using R. You can change {r} to {python} to simply switch the chunk to a Python code chunk.
First, you need to run library(reticulate) in the R code chunk to make R and Python communicate with each other!</description>
