      <description>Meet Louis!   This is my cat, Louis! =^._.^=
 Louis is a yellow tabby cat, and he is 5 years old. He likes to eat, look out the window, groom himself, and sleep.
 He is not the nicest cat, but he has a really pretty voice. He is really soft also.
He used to be an indoor/outdoor cat, but he would dig up our neighbors&#39; gardens that we now have to keep him inside :( He would still try to run out the door whenever he gets a chance.</description>
